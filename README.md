To use Nodemailer to send a link to a user's Gmail, the .env file needs to be modified.

EMAIL_SENDER = 'YOUR SENDER EMAIL'
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'YOUR EMAIL APP PASSWORD'

Gmail app password(16-character passcode) needs to be generated in accounts security settings. 2-Step Verification needs to be enabled to use app password.
